echo "✅ Updates: JawabanSiswa table with updateOrCreate\n";
echo "✅ Security: Verifies hasil_ujian belongs to current siswa\n\n";

echo "Frontend JavaScript:\n";
echo "✅ selectAnswer(): Updates UI, saves to answers object, calls saveCurrentAnswer()\n";
echo "✅ saveCurrentAnswer(): Sends AJAX POST to save-answer endpoint\n";
echo "✅ updateProgress(): Updates navigation button colors and progress bar\n";
echo "✅ restoreSelectedAnswer(): Restores selection when returning to question\n\n";

echo "=== FLOW VERIFICATION ===\n";
echo "1. Student clicks answer → selectAnswer() called\n";
echo "2. UI updated → option highlighted, answers object updated\n";
echo "3. Auto-save triggered → saveCurrentAnswer() after 500ms delay\n";
