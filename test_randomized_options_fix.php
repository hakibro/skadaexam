echo "=== RANDOMIZED ANSWER OPTIONS FIX ===\n";
echo "Issue: jika opsi jawaban diacak, opsi terpilih tertandai posisinya sementara\n";
echo "       ketika siswa kembali ke soal tersebut posisi tanda tetap namun opsi jawaban berubah.\n";
echo "       harusnya posisi tanda mengikuti opsi jawaban yang dipilih siswa\n\n";

echo "=== PROBLEM ANALYSIS ===\n";
echo "❌ Before Fix:\n";
echo "   1. Student selects option A (content: 'Answer X')\n";
echo "   2. System saves 'A' to database\n";
echo "   3. When returning, options are re-randomized\n";
echo "   4. Now option A has different content ('Answer Y')\n";
echo "   5. But position A is still highlighted\n";
echo "   6. Selected marker doesn't follow the actual answer content\n\n";

echo "✅ After Fix:\n";
echo "   1. Student selects option A (content: 'Answer X')\n";
echo "   2. System saves 'A' to database\n";
echo "   3. When returning, same randomization is applied (consistent seed)\n";
echo "   4. Option A still has same content ('Answer X')\n";
echo "   5. Position A is correctly highlighted\n";
echo "   6. Selected marker follows the actual answer content\n\n";

echo "=== TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ===\n";
echo "File: app/Http/Controllers/Siswa/SiswaDashboardController.php\n";
echo "Method: exam() - Transform questions section\n\n";

echo "BEFORE:\n";
echo "  if (\$jadwalUjian->acak_jawaban) {\n";
echo "      \$keys = array_keys(\$options);\n";
echo "      shuffle(\$keys); // Random every time\n";
echo "      // ... shuffle logic\n";
echo "  }\n\n";

echo "AFTER:\n";
echo "  if (\$jadwalUjian->acak_jawaban) {\n";
echo "      // Use consistent seed based on siswa_id and soal_id\n";
echo "      \$seed = \$siswa->id * 1000 + \$soal->id;\n";
echo "      mt_srand(\$seed);\n";
echo "      \$keys = array_keys(\$options);\n";
echo "      shuffle(\$keys); // Same randomization every time for same student+question\n";
echo "      // ... shuffle logic\n";
echo "      mt_srand(); // Reset seed\n";
echo "  }\n\n";

echo "=== SEED CALCULATION ===\n";
echo "Seed Formula: siswa_id * 1000 + soal_id\n";
echo "Example:\n";
echo "  Student ID: 5, Question ID: 123\n";
echo "  Seed: 5 * 1000 + 123 = 5123\n";
echo "  Result: Same randomization every time this student sees this question\n\n";

echo "=== BENEFITS ===\n";
echo "✅ Consistent randomization per student-question pair\n";
echo "✅ Selected answers remain in correct positions\n";
echo "✅ Answer highlighting follows actual content\n";
echo "✅ No database structure changes needed\n";
echo "✅ Maintains exam integrity (different randomization per student)\n\n";

echo "=== TESTING SCENARIOS ===\n";
echo "Test Case 1: Single Question Answer Persistence\n";
echo "  1. Navigate to question with randomized options\n";
echo "  2. Select an answer (note the content)\n";
echo "  3. Navigate to another question\n";
echo "  4. Return to original question\n";
echo "  5. Verify same option content is highlighted\n\n";

echo "Test Case 2: Multiple Students Different Randomization\n";
echo "  1. Student A sees Question 1 with options randomized\n";
echo "  2. Student B sees Question 1 with different randomization\n";
echo "  3. Both should have consistent randomization on revisit\n\n";

echo "Test Case 3: Answer Navigation Flow\n";
echo "  1. Answer multiple questions with randomized options\n";
echo "  2. Use navigation buttons to revisit questions\n";
echo "  3. All selected answers should be correctly highlighted\n\n";

echo "=== EXPECTED BEHAVIOR ===\n";
echo "✅ Same student + same question = same option order always\n";
echo "✅ Different students = different option randomization\n";
echo "✅ Selected answer marker follows content, not position\n";
echo "✅ Navigation buttons correctly show answered status\n";
echo "✅ No impact on non-randomized questions\n\n";

echo "STATUS: ✅ FIXED - Consistent seeding ensures answer positions follow content\n";
