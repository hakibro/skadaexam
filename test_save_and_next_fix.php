echo "1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)\n";
echo "2. Go to Console tab\n";
echo "3. Click 'Simpan & Lanjut' button\n";
echo "4. Check console for debugging messages:\n";
echo "   - 'saveAndNext clicked, currentQuestionIndex: X, totalQuestions: Y'\n";
echo "   - 'saveCurrentAnswer called'\n";
echo "   - 'Save successful, navigating to next question' OR 'Save failed: error'\n";
echo "   - 'navigateQuestion called with direction: next'\n";
echo "   - 'Navigating to question: X'\n\n";

echo "=== POSSIBLE ISSUES & SOLUTIONS ===\n\n";

echo "A. If no console messages appear:\n";
echo "   ❌ Issue: onclick handler not working\n";

echo "   ✅ Solution: Check network errors or backend issues\n\n";

echo "C. If save works but navigation doesn't:\n";

echo "=== EXPECTED FLOW ===\n";
echo "1. User clicks 'Simpan & Lanjut'\n";
echo "2. saveAndNext() logs click event\n";
echo "3. saveCurrentAnswer() attempts to save (if answer selected)\n";
echo "4. navigateQuestion('next') called regardless of save result\n";
echo "5. navigateToQuestion() redirects to next question URL\n";
echo "6. Page reloads with next question\n\n";

echo "1. Navigate to exam page\n";
echo "2. Select an answer (optional)\n";
echo "3. Open Developer Tools Console\n";
echo "4. Click 'Simpan & Lanjut' button\n";
echo "5. Watch console messages to identify where it fails\n";
echo "6. Should navigate to next question automatically\n\n";

echo "STATUS: ✅ DEBUGGING ENABLED - Check browser console for detailed logs\n";
